# Course-Manager
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description
This is my CS50 project AKA Course Manager.Sometimes it's hard to remember all information and deadlines while you enroll online courses on different platforms. Hence, this web application would be a good course tracker to use.<br>

You can start using it by running the app and create an account. In each of your account, you can add or delete courses as you like. An interface called Dashboard is in this web application. In there, you can see the information about the courses you added, and also the nearest deadline that is coming.
